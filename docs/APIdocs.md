# Basics

## Base URL

The base URL for all API requests is: `https://oasis-api.merkins.io/api`. This means all the `/resources` used from now on in this documentation must be preceded by the base URL when performing the request.

## Authentication

API requests are made over HTTPS and authenticated with a key. This key is supplied as the {token} in an HTTP Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`

To get your key:

1. Create an HTTP POST request to `/authentication` to perform the login.
2. Set the HTTP Content type header `Content-Type: application/json`.
3. Set a JSON body as follows:

    ```json
    {
      "email": "your_user@email.com",
      "password": "your-username-password",
    }
    ```

4. The response from this request will return the current user data, along with the JWT token:

    ```json
    {
      "currentUser": {
        // <Current User data>
      },
      "token": "<JWT Token>"
    }
    ```

5. Once the token is retrieved, it must be present in all the future request in the HTTP authorization header.

## Requests

### Basic Concepts

The API is organized around REST: resources are accessed with URL endpoints and manipulated using HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE verbs. GET is used for reading resources, POST is used for creating resources, PUT for updating resources, and DELETE is used for deleting resources.

In general, resources identifiers are specified in the URL. In cases where objects are being created or updated, additional parameters are sent in the request body.

### Headers

When making all requests, the authorization header must be set and include the API key in the token portion of the authorization header: Authorization: Bearer {token}

In addition, when making requests that create or update a resource, parameters are sent as JSON in the POST request and the content type header must be set to the JSON content type: Content-Type: application/json

## Responses

### Basic Concepts

In most cases, responses are returned as JSON, and the HTTP status code indicates success or failure. In general, response codes in the 200-level range indicate success, response codes in the 400-level range indicate a failure caused by a request that canâ€™t be fulfilled even though the service is working as expected, and response codes in the 500-level range indicate a failure caused by a problem with the service itself.

HTTP status codes have the following meanings:

| Code | Meaning               |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 200  | OK                    |
| 400  | Bad request           |
| 401  | Unauthorized          |
| 403  | Forbidden             |
| 404  | Not found             |
| 500  | Internal server error |
